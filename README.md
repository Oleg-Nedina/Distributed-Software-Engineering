# Galaxy Trucker - Distributed Implementation 🎲

A digital implementation of the board game *Galaxy Trucker* built with **Java** using a distributed **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
* **Network:** Full support for both **RMI** (Remote Method Invocation) and **TCP Socket** connections.
* **Concurrency:** Multi-threaded server handling multiple matches and clients simultaneously.
* **Resilience:** Handling of client disconnections and server persistence.
* **UI:** Double interface: Command Line Interface (CLI) for performance and Graphical User Interface (GUI) with JavaFX.

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution

I took a **leadership role** in the architectural design phase and contributed to the project as a full-stack developer, overseeing the entire lifecycle from design to deployment.

* **Team Coordination & Architecture:** Led the design team, establishing **coding conventions** and project structure. I defined the core **Design Patterns** and shared interfaces to ensure modularity and code maintainability.
* **Core Logic:** Implemented the **Player Model** and the primary **Controller** logic, managing the state flow of the game.
* **Network Protocol:** Designed the common communication language and interfaces used for Client-Server interaction.
* **User Interface:** Fully developed the **CLI (Command Line Interface)** engine and provided architectural support for the integration of the **GUI (JavaFX)**.
